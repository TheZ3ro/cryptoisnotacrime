        <blockquote>Specifically, government officials in the U.S. and Europe are pushing to ban strong encryption technology.
          They want every type of Internet security to have a "backdoor" so that governments can access literally everything.
          Here's the problem: <span class="highlight">weakening encryption will actually make us all less safe.</span>
          Even if you trust governments to never abuse this system and only use it in the most extreme circumstances,
          once a backdoor exists, it can be used by anyone who can find it, including criminals,
          other governments, and yes, even terrorists.

        <blockquote><span class="highlight">When you make a credit card payment or log into Facebook, you're using the same fundamental encryption that,
           in another continent, an activist could be using to organize a protest against a failed regime.</span>
           <br/>
           In a way, we're implementing a fundamental technological advancement not dissimilar from the invention of cars or airplanes.
           Ford and Toyota build automobiles so that the entire world can have access to faster transportation and a better quality of life.
           If a terrorist is suspected of using a Toyota as a car bomb, it's not reasonable to expect Toyota to start
           screening who it sells cars to, or to stop selling cars altogether.

        <blockquote>Like the laws of physics, encryption is also written in mathematics.
          All information can be expressed in bits: a series of ones and zeros.
          Through decades of pain-staking research brilliant cryptographers have figured out how to take a random number (called a key)
           and a collection of organized bits (such as an email, or a video, or a PowerPoint slideshow) and scramble them, using mathematics,
            to end up with another set of bits that's indistinguishable from random. [...]<br/>
            <span class="highlight">The fact that encryption is possible is one of the marvels of our universe and of mathematics,
            the language that our universe is written in.</span>
